# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Github holds the 'source of truth' 

Researched answer: From the syllabus: Git is a free, open-source version control system widely used in the programming world. Git is a technology that is independent of any programming language or computer operating system.  
GitHub is an online platform that uses git version control technology. GitHub allows developers to share and store code.  GitHub holds the source code for applications. The source code lives in named directories called repositories or repo for short. A repository can hold many other directories and files of code that make up a project.


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An array's index is the 'position' and the data type in that 'position'.  For example: ["cat", 3, ["dog, 0]] is an array with three elements.  Position 0 holds the string data type: cat.  Position 0 holds the numerical value 3.  Position 2 holds another array with a string and integer.

Researched answer: The index is a numeric identifier assienged to each element in the array which represents the position of the element within the array.  Indices from Array start from 0 in most programming languages.
The value is the actual data stored in an element of the array.  It can be store any data type such as integers, strings, objects, etc and represents the information that you are storing or manipulating withint the array.  

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Strings are immutable which means the contents within a string cannot be changed.  Arrays however are mutable which means I can change the element in a position to another element.  There are also methods I cannot use on a Array but I can use on a string such as .toUpperCase(). Some similarities are that you can use methods such as .length to return an integer.  Both string and integer also starts with an index 0.  

Researched answer: Similarities: both are sequences of elements, you can access individual elements in both arrays and strings using an index.  You can iterate through both arrays and strings using loops so process each elemtn or character in the sequence.  You can also find the length of both an array and string.  

    differences:  they are different data types, where an array can store different data types whereas a string can only store characters.  You can use methods in Arrays such as .push, .pop,. .shift, .splice, where strings have methods such as split, slice, concat.  

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions:A higher-order function is a built in method in JavaScript that takes in a function as an argument. 

2. Jest:Testing is the process of creating automated quality assurance for code. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: Objects are a JavaScript data type that has collections of key:value pairs. Objects can contain static information as well as actions in the form of methods.
